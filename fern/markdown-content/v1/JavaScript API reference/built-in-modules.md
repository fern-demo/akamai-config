These modules are available to use in your EdgeWorkers code bundles to provide a class or a library of functions for a specific purpose.

Because your EdgeWorker is compiled as an ES6 Module, you have access to static import. You can utilize this to load relative JavaScript files as modules and use them in your "main.js" file that contains the callbacks used to modify HTTP requests and responses. See the example section for details.
