A 400 response usually indicates invalid or missing required parameters, but can trigger for many reasons. This sample 400 error represents an attempt to activate an EdgeWorker that's already active: 

```json
{
  "detail": "This version is already being activated on staging",
  "instance": "/edgeworkers/error-instances/8b95c971-f6b3-4479-a393-202be75e43e1",
  "status": 400,
  "title": "Bad Request.",
  "type": "/edgeworkers/error-types/edgeworkers-bad-request",
  "errorCode": "EW1021"
}
```
