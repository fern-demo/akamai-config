You can use the EdgeWorkers service to run JavaScript at the edge of the Internet to dynamically manage web traffic. You can use the EdgeWorkers API to deploy custom code on thousands of edge servers and apply logic that creates powerful web experiences.

Use the EdgeWorkers service to:

- Redirect requests based on geography, device, and user-agent.

- Apply conditional logic to filter requests and construct responses.

- Customize error responses to improve web experiences, even when the origin is down.

- Add or remove debug information from HTTP responses.
