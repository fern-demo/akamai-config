If you have an active {{COMPANY_NICKNAME}} contract and login credentials for {{PORTAL_NAME}} you can use these instructions to sign up for the EdgeWorkers Evaluation tier. The Evaluation tier lets you try EdgeWorkers for free and without a time limit. 

If you're not already an {{COMPANY_NICKNAME}} customer or you don't have access to {{PORTAL_NAME}} you can sign up for an [EdgeWorkers free trial](edgeworkers-free-trial.md).

When you're ready to purchase EdgeWorkers you can also use [Marketplace](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/what-we-do/intelligent-platform/control-center/akamai-marketplace-faq.jsp). If you need help signing up or would like more information, contact an {{COMPANY_NICKNAME}} account representative.

5. Click **Pricing** to activate a compute package (also known as resource tiers).  

   Resource tiers let you select between different sets of resource consumption limits and corresponding billing rates for your EdgeWorkers functions. Currently, we have three resource tiers available, Dynamic Compute, Enterprise Compute, and Basic Compute.

6. Select **Dynamic Compute**, **Enterprise Compute**, or **Basic Compute** based on your preference. You can even enable both at the same time, allowing you the flexibility to choose any of the resource tiers during the EdgeWorkers setup process.
