    "3-1": "Use an integrated development environment (IDE) for JavaScript development. Extensions are add-ons that let you customize and enhance your experience in an IDE.

It can also reduce the risk of regression.  \n  \nA unit test runs code over each segment of your program, checking the input and output. These tests allow developers to check individual areas of a program to see where and why errors are occurring.",
