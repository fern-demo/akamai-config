mPulse is â€‹Akamaiâ€‹'s real user measurement solution that provides near real-time feedback about how your site is performing. mPulse reports for EdgeWorkers include data about EdgeWorkers errors generated due to JavaScript errors. You can view the error reports in the mPulse dashboard.  

> ðŸ“˜ To use this feature you need to be part of an mPulse paid plan. For more information about setting up and using mPulse refer to the [mPulse guide](https://techdocs.akamai.com/mpulse/docs).

## Enable mPulse error reports for EdgeWorkers

1. Before you begin, make sure that your property includes the mPulse behavior and that you have followed the set up instructions described in the mPulse guide.

   The mPulse behavior is enabled by default on some properties. If your property does not already include [mPulse](https://techdocs.akamai.com/property-mgr/docs/mpulse-beh) refer to the instructions in the [Property Manager guide](https://techdocs.akamai.com/property-mgr/docs/behs) for more information.

   Once the mPulse-enabled property is active on the â€‹Akamaiâ€‹ production network, your data (beacons) are directed to your mPulse app. See [How mPulse works](https://techdocs.akamai.com/mpulse/docs/how-mpulse-works) to learn more. 

2. Next, use the toggle button in the EdgeWorkers behavior to set **Enable mPulse error reports** to **On**.

3. To stop generating the EdgeWorkers error reports in mPulse you can set the toggle button to **Off**.

> ðŸ“˜ If mPulse is unavailable on your property you will be prompted to enable it before you can turn on the EdgeWorkers reports.
