You can integrate EdgeWorkers logging data into the Log Delivery Service. This will help provide visibility into EdgeWorkers status and failure over the specified period of time.

Before you begin, refer to the [Log Delivery Service documentation](https://techdocs.akamai.com/log-delivery/docs) for instructions on how to create a log delivery configuration.

The Log Delivery Service allows up to 128 characters in the log output. Any text after 128 characters is truncated.
