This report lists execution success and error statuses, grouped by event handler.

If the EdgeWorker version includes child EdgeWorkers, the active revision ID also appears in the graph. For more information see, [Flexible composition](flexible-composition.md).

### Execution status summary for selected EdgeWorker IDs

View the **Execution status summary** for information about the total number of executions that resulted in success and error and the execution error rate. 

The summary includes data for all the EdgeWorker IDs you selected for the report.

### Execution success and error status

This section of the report displays information for one version of an EdgeWorker ID at a time. To view the data for a specific EdgeWorker ID, select it from the dropdown.

The percent of successful and failed executions is also displayed in the donut chart.

### All execution statuses

This report lets you view the execution statuses in a list that shows:

- The number of EdgeWorkers hits generated for each status.
- The percentage of all EdgeWorkers hits generated by each status.

You can filter the report to display the results for a specific status. Review the following table for a description of each of the available statuses.

<br/>
| Error | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Success | EdgeWorkers function executed successfully. |
| Generic error | Unnamed or uncategorized error. |
| Unknown EdgeWorker ID | The EdgeWorker ID is not [activated](manage-edgeworkers.md#activate-an-edgeworker-version). |
| Runtime error | Error at runtime or environment prevented EdgeWorkers execution. |
| Execution error | Error during EdgeWorkers execution, such as JavaScript exception or error. |
| Timeout error | EdgeWorkers function timed out. |
| Resource limit hit | The EdgeWorkers function exceeded the amount of memory it is allowed to use. Review the [Resource tier limitations](resource-tier-limitations.md) for more information. |
| CPU timeout error | The EdgeWorkers function exceeded the allowed CPU time when running an event handler. For more information see, [Product limits](limitations.md). |
| Wall timeout error | The EdgeWorkers function exceeded the allowed Wall time when running an event handler. For more information see, [Product limits](limitations.md). |
| Init CPU timeout error | The EdgeWorkers function exceeded the allowed CPU time during initialization.<br/><br/>This can occur if the EdgeWorkers code bundle contains too much JavaScript to load within the time limits. It can also occur if the EdgeWorkers function attempts to perform too many calculations during initialization.<br/><br/>For more information see, [Product limits](limitations.md). |
| Init wall timeout error | The EdgeWorkers function exceeded the allowed wall time during initialization.<br/><br/>This can occur if the EdgeWorkers code bundle contains too much JavaScript to load within the time limits. It can also occur if the EdgeWorkers function attempts to perform too many calculations during initialization.<br/><br/>For more information see, [Product limits](limitations.md). |
| subWorker not enabled | The EdgeWorkers code bundle is not enabled as a subWorker.<br/><br/>This can occur if a sub-request is made to an EdgeWorker and the code bundle is not [enabled as a subWorker](create-a-subworker.md#enable-subworkers) .<br/><br/>**Note:** The sub-request will bypass the EdgeWorker and continue processing. |
| subWorker limit hit | The EdgeWorkers function exceeded the subWorkers product limits and did not execute.<br/><br/>This can occur when the maximum number of nested subWorkers allowed for a single root sub-request is exceeded.<br/><br/>When this happens, the sub-request that called the subWorker receives a 500 HTTP response code. |
