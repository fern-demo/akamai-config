This report lists execution success and error statuses, grouped by event handler.

If the EdgeWorker version includes child EdgeWorkers, the active revision ID also appears in the graph. For more information see, [Flexible composition](doc:flexible-composition).

 ![Execution status overview](https://techdocs.akamai.com/edgeworkers/img/executionStatusReport-v2.png)

### Execution status summary for selected EdgeWorker IDs

View the **Execution status summary** for information about the total number of executions that resulted in success and error and the execution error rate. 

The summary includes data for all the EdgeWorker IDs you selected for the report.

### Execution success and error status

This section of the report displays information for one version of an EdgeWorker ID at a time. To view the data for a specific EdgeWorker ID, select it from the dropdown.

The percent of successful and failed executions is also displayed in the donut chart.

### All execution statuses

This report lets you view the execution statuses in a list that shows:

- The number of EdgeWorkers hits generated for each status.
- The percentage of all EdgeWorkers hits generated by each status.

You can filter the report to display the results for a specific status. Review the following table for a description of each of the available statuses.
