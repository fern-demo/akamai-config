You can deliver the JavaScript logs via [Enhanced debug headers](doc:enable-enhanced-debug-headers) or a [DataStream 2](doc:ds2-javascript-logging).

# Enhanced debug header logging details

Each event handler returns a corresponding response header. A response header is only returned when logging information is available for the event. The log header name starts with X-Akamai-EdgeWorker:

- X-Akamai-EdgeWorker-onClientRequest-Log
- X-Akamai-EdgeWorker-onOriginRequest-Log
- X-Akamai-EdgeWorker-onClientResponse-Log
- X-Akamai-EdgeWorker-onOriginResponse-Log
- X-Akamai-EdgeWorker-responseProvider-Log

You can also add the `X-Akamai-EdgeWorker-subworkers-Log` request header to limit which EdgeWorkers collect JavaScript logs. This can help you stay with the JavaScript Logging limits. For more information go to [subWorkers JavaScript Logging details](doc:javascript-logging-details-copy#javascript-logging-for-subworkers).

> ðŸ“˜ You can configure the JavaScript logs to appear in an [LDS server log](https://techdocs.akamai.com/log-delivery/docs) or a [DataStream 2 log](doc:datastream-2-integration).

## Enhanced debug header logging format

EdgeWorkers JavaScript logging returns logs in the following format `<debug-level>`:`<file>`:`<line>` `<message>`.

# Data Stream 2 JavaScript logging details

You can generate these logs by following the steps in the [Use DataStream 2 to deliver JavaScript logs](doc:javascript-logging) tutorial.

The following is an example of the JSON data output by DataStream 2. If you select the JSON output option for your logs, `timestamp` and `version` are renamed to `time` and `format` to facilitate the naming conventions of specific endpoints.

```json
[
{ 
  "severity": "ERROR",
  "time": "1718023875520000000",
  "version": "1",
  "body": "onClientRequest%20test%20%20error%20level",
  "ds2id": "71321",
  "format": "1",
  "attributes": {
    "request_id": "1a1a1a1"
  },
  "resource": {
    "cloud.provider": "AkamaiEdgeWorkers",
    "ew": "42",
    "ewv": "0.9",
    "ip": "<ip address of the log source>"
  }
}

]
```

## Data Stream 2 logging format

EdgeWorkers JavaScript logging returns logs in the following format, `timestamp` `version` `ds2id` `severity` `traceid` `spanid` `traceflags` `resource` `attributes` `body`.

  "data": {
