Most developers use an integrated development environment (IDE) for JavaScript development. Extensions are add-ons that let you customize and enhance your experience in an IDE. You can add new features or integrate existing tools to increase your productivity and customize your workflow. Extensions also provide a quick, simple way for you to work your “inner loop” process of coding, building, and testing directly when using an IDE.

Two popular IDEs, Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ, include built-in extensions for EdgeWorkers. For more information and instructions you can refer to the getting started guides:
