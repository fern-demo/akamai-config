The code bundle editor is built-in to the EdgeWorkers Management application. You can use this  custom tool to edit your EdgeWorkers without having to set up an integrated development environment or use a command line interface.

This tool is useful as a quick editor so you can view, validate, and edit the files in your code bundles.

1. Log in to Control Center.

2. Go to <<PORTAL_ICON_ROOT>> <<CHAR_MENU_DELIMITER>> **CDN** <<CHAR_MENU_DELIMITER>> **EdgeWorkers**.

3. Select the EdgeWorker ID you want to edit.

4. Select an EdgeWorker version from the EdgeWorker details page to edit an existing EdgeWorker version.

5. Select the **Code Bundle** tab.

   The files included in the EdgeWorker version appear in the Code bundle editor.
