To create the EdgeWorkers bundle, you need a JavaScript source file called `main.js` that contains event handler definitions for when to execute the code:

- `onClientRequest`. This event happens for every request as the request is received, before checking if a response is available in cache.

- `onOriginRequest`. This event happens just before sending the request to the origin.

- `onOriginResponse`. This event happens as the origin response is created.

- `onClientResponse`. This event happens for every request just before the client response is sent.

- `responseProvider`. This event happens if the response is not already found in cache. You can use `responseProvider` to generate dynamic responses from various content and API sources.

You also need to create a manifest file called `bundle.json` that includes meta information as described in the table below.
