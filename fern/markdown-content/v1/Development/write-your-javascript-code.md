Once the EdgeWorkers service is set up, you can write the JavaScript code you want to execute at the edge and [create a code bundle](create-a-code-bundle.md).

- If you're just getting started you can follow the steps in the [Hello World tutorial](hello-world-edgeworkers-management-application.md) . 
- You can also find several code samples, sorted by use case in the [EdgeWorkers GitHub repo](https://github.com/akamai/edgeworkers-examples/tree/master/edgecompute/examples).
- Once you're ready, you can review the [JavaScript API reference](about-the-javascript-api.md) and start designing your own EdgeWorkers functions.

When you're done creating your code bundle, you can return to Hello World to learn how to [deploy and test](deploy-hello-world-1.md) on the {{COMPANY_NICKNAME}} staging network.
