Once the EdgeWorkers service is set up, you can write the JavaScript code you want to execute at the edge and [create a code bundle](doc:create-a-code-bundle).

- If you're just getting started you can follow the steps in the [Hello World tutorial](doc:hello-world-edgeworkers-management-application) . 
- You can also find several code samples, sorted by use case in the [EdgeWorkers GitHub repo](https://github.com/akamai/edgeworkers-examples/tree/master/edgecompute/examples).
- Once you're ready, you can review the [JavaScript API reference](doc:about-the-javascript-api) and start designing your own EdgeWorkers functions.

When you're done creating your code bundle, you can return to Hello World to learn how to [deploy and test](doc:deploy-hello-world-1) on the <<COMPANY_NICKNAME>> staging network.
