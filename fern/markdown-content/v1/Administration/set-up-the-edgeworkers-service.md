Once you've [added EdgeWorkers to your contract](doc:add-edgeworkers-to-contract) you'll need to take care of some administrative tasks to configure your <<COMPANY_NICKNAME>> property to execute EdgeWorkers functions. You can follow the steps in our [Hello World tutorial](doc:hello-world-edgeworkers-management-application) and watch this five minute video to learn how to:

- [Create an EdgeWorker ID](doc:create-an-edgeworker-id).
- [Add the EdgeWorkers behavior](doc:add-the-edgeworkers-behavior) to your property and activate it on the <<COMPANY_NICKNAME>> staging network.
