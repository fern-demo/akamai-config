Keep these limitations in mind when designing your EdgeWorkers functions. These limitations apply to all EdgeWorkers functions regardless of the selected [resource tier](doc:select-a-resource-tier).

You can also refer to the [limitations](doc:resource-tier-limitations) that are applied based on the resource tier you selected for your EdgeWorker ID.

> ðŸ“˜ Implicit wall time limit of the parent EdgeWorker
> 
> If the parent EdgeWorker uses too much wall time waiting for the subWorker to respond, the request will time out. This terminates the request from the original browser.

## Flexible composition limits

These limits apply to EdgeWorkers functions created using flexible composition. 

> ðŸ“˜ The  existing [Product](doc:limitations) and [Resource tier](doc:resource-tier-limitations) limits also apply to the parent EdgeWorker and to all of the parent's child EdgeWorkers. The limits do not apply individually to each EdgeWorker in a combined code bundle.

## Limits for JavaScript logs delivered via DataStream 2

These limits apply when you use [DataStream 2 to deliver JavaScript logs](doc:ds2-javascript-logging).
