This section describes how to enable the EdgeWorkers behavior in Property Manager. When you add the EdgeWorkers behavior you can also define which requests apply EdgeWorkers functions. By limiting the scope you can avoid unnecessary serverless hits to improve performance and reduce cost.

Before you begin, make sure you've reviewed the prerequisites. To complete these steps you need access to {{PORTAL_NAME}}.

> üëç To specify and configure an action to take in the event that an EdgeWorkers function fails, add the [Site Failover](site-failover.md) behavior to your property.

1. Navigate to your property in {{PORTAL_NICKNAME}}.

2. Click **Edit**.

3. Click **Add rule**.

4. Enter **Hello World EdgeWorkers use case** as the name of your rule.

5. Choose a `match criteria` and `scope`.

   You can use Property Manager to scope where and when to execute the EdgeWorkers function. This criteria allows you to define which requests apply EdgeWorkers functions. By limiting the scope you can avoid unnecessary serverless hits.
