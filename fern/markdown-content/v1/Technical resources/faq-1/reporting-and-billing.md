### How are EdgeWorkers charged?

EdgeWorkers are charged by the number of events invoked per month. You can review the [Select a resource tier](select-a-resource-tier.md) and the [Resource tiers terminology](select-a-resource-tier.md#resource-tiers-and-billing-terminology) sections for more information. 

### What do EdgeWorkers reports look like? Are they real-time?

You can learn more and see examples in the [Reports](manage-report-data.md)  section. Reports provide insight into usage (the number of events invoked), resource consumption, and errors.
