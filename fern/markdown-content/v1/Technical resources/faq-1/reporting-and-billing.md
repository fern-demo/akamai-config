### How are EdgeWorkers charged?

EdgeWorkers are charged by the number of events invoked per month. You can review the [Select a resource tier](doc:select-a-resource-tier) and the [Resource tiers terminology](doc:select-a-resource-tier#resource-tiers-and-billing-terminology) sections for more information. 

### What do EdgeWorkers reports look like? Are they real-time?

You can learn more and see examples in the [Reports](doc:manage-report-data)  section. Reports provide insight into usage (the number of events invoked), resource consumption, and errors.
