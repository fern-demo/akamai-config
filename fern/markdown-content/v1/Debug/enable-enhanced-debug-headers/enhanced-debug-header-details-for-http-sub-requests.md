Here's a curl request that passes the Pragma `akamai-x-ew-debug` and `akamai-x-ew-debug-subs` request headers. The `akamai-x-ew-debug-subs` request header is required in addition to the standard debug header to receive sub-request debug headers.

```curl
curl "http://www.example.com" -H "Pragma: akamai-x-ew-debug, akamai-x-ew-debug-subs" -H 'Akamai-EW-Trace: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1Qi ... iu1XOS9eJOl-54Yw
```

Hereâ€™s an example of an HTTP sub-request response header:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

```

Each sub-request issued by the EdgeWorkers function returns a separate response header. These debug headers include several additional fields to identify and describe the sub-request.
