Here's a curl request that passes the Pragma `akamai-x-ew-debug` and `akamai-x-ew-debug-subs` request headers. The `akamai-x-ew-debug-subs` request header is required in addition to the standard debug header to receive sub-request debug headers.

```curl
curl "http://www.example.com" -H "Pragma: akamai-x-ew-debug, akamai-x-ew-debug-subs" -H 'Akamai-EW-Trace: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1Qi ... iu1XOS9eJOl-54Yw
```

Hereâ€™s an example of an HTTP sub-request response header:

```http

Each sub-request issued by the EdgeWorkers function returns a separate response header. These debug headers include several additional fields to identify and describe the sub-request.
| Response header field | Details | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| EdgeWorker ID ew=`<ew>` | `<ew>` | EdgeWorker ID |
| Event handler evt=`<evt>` | `<evt>` | Identifier of the event handler that issued the HTTP sub-request. Possible values include:<br/><b>CReq</b> for requests issued by the `onClientRequest` event handler<br/><b>OReq</b> for requests issued by the `onOriginRequest` event handler<br/><b>ORsp</b> for requests issued by the `onOriginResponse` event handler<br/><b>CRsp</b> for requests issued by the `onClientResponse` event handler<br/><b>RP </b> for requests issued by the `responseProvider` event handler |
| HTTP sub-request ID =`<id>` | `<id>` | ID assigned to the HTTP sub-request starting at 1. The sub-request ID increments by 1 for each given event handler invocation. |
| HTTP sub-request method = `<method>` | `<method>` | HTTP request method for the sub-request that indicates an action to apply to a given resource. |
| URL targeted by sub-request url=`<url>` | `<url>` | Fully-qualified URL, delimited by quotation marks, to which the HTTP sub-request was issued. If the URL contains characters not allowed in HTTP headers, it is also per cent encoded.<br/>See the `<url_truncated>` and `<url_encoded>` fields for more information. |
| URL encoded url_encoded=`<url_encoded>` | `<url_encoded>` | Only appears with a value of 1 when the value of the field is percent-encoded on top of any percent encoding present in the URL value sent in the request. |
| HTTP sub-request response rsp=`<rsp>` | `<rsp>` | Response to the HTTP sub-request. Possible values include:<br/>An integer status code in the range of 200-599.<br/>The value "pending" if the event handler invocation finished before the HTTP sub-request was complete.<br/>This field is absent if the HTTP sub-request was not resolved due to an error. |
| HTTP sub-request response error err=`<err>` | `<err>` | Only included when an error occurs while waiting for the HTTP sub-request response. |
| Time to resolve promise dur=`<dur>` | `<dur>` | Time in milliseconds it took for the HTTP sub-request to resolve the promise. The promise, made as part of an EdgeWorkers JavaScript request, can be resolved with the contents of the response header or an exception.<br/>This field is absent if the request was still pending when the event handler invocation completed. |
| Error when reading response body body_err=`<body_err>` | `<body_err>` | Short string indicating the type of error that occurred while reading from the body of the HTTP sub-request response. This field includes the reason argument if a cancellation was triggered by the EdgeWorkers code using the `ReadableStream.cancel()` method.<br/>The value is percent-encoded and delimited by quotations if it contains spaces or characters with special semantics in the HTTP headers. Currently values longer than 100 characters are truncated.<br/>This field is absent if no errors occurred when reading the response body. |
| Response body truncated Body_err truncated=`<body_err_truncated>` | `<body_err_truncated>` | Only included with a value of 1 when the value of the `<body_err>` field is truncated. |
| Time to read HTTP sub-request total_dur=`<total_dur>` | `<total_dur>` | Time in milliseconds between the EdgeWorkers code request for the HTTP sub-request and when the response body was either read to completion or terminated by an error.<br/>This field is absent if the response body was not read to completion prior to the event handler invocation completing. |
| Queuing information due to concurrent HTTP sub-request limitations rate_limited=`<rate_limited>` | `<rate_limited>` | Information about HTTP sub-requests queued due to [limitations](limitations.md)  on the supported number of concurrent sub-requests per event handler.<br/> An HTTP sub-request can halt if the event finishes while the sub-request was still in the queue or if the sub-request times out while in the queue. This field is absent if the request was not queued. |
| Time in queue due limitations on concurrent HTTP sub-requests rate_limited_dur=`<rate_limited_dur>` | `<rate_limited_dur>` | Time in queue due to the per-handler [limitations](limitations.md) on concurrent sub-requests.<br/>This field is absent if the request was not queued or if the request timed out while in the queue. If a timeout occurs, the `<dur>` field also reflects the timeout. |
