You can now configure an EdgeWorkers function to execute via an [ESI (Edge Side Includes)](https://techdocs.akamai.com/property-mgr/docs/esi-edge-side-includes) fragment request on the enhanced TLS network. 

To execute EdgeWorkers from an ESI fragment, add the  `PMUSER_ENABLE_EW_ESI_FRAG` [user-defined variable](https://techdocs.akamai.com/property-mgr/docs/user-defined-vars) to your rule and set it to `true`. The name of the variable must be UPPERCASE.

> ðŸ“˜ 
> 
> The user-defined variable is not required if you are using the Standard TLS delivery method. ESI is supported on the standard TLS network.
