We've made updates to the EdgeWorkers JavaScript API built-in modules and expanded support for ReadableStreams in the contents of the request body.

- You can now reference public keys locally within your EdgeWorkers code bundle and pass them into the [crypto built-in module](doc:crypto). Crypto libraries, such as crypto-es, no longer need to be packed locally into the EdgeWorkers code bundle. 

- The [encoding built-in module](doc:encoding) now supports `atob()`, and `btoa()` in your EdgeWorkers code bundles to handle text in various character encodings, including legacy non-UTF-8.

- The `Request Object` now supports a [`body`](doc:request-object#body) property. This read-only ReadableStream value is used to read the contents of the request body. It is only available when using the `responseProvider` event. 

- The body property of the [`httpRequest()`](doc:http-request) function now supports ReadableStreams in the contents of the request body.
