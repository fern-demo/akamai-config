All EdgeWorkers PMUSER_BYPASS variables are now evaluated at the stage that corresponds to the event handler. For example, PMUSER_BYPASS_EW_CLTREQ_EVENT is now evaluated in `onClientRequest`. Previously the PMUSER_BYPASS variables were all evaluated at the `content-policy` metadata stage regardless of the event handler invoking the request.
