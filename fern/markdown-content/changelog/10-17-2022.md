You can now use the [EdgeWorkers Code Profiler](doc:edgeworkers-code-profiler) to gain insight about the CPU performance of your EdgeWorkers code. 

The profiler is available as part of the latest version of the [EdgeWorkers VS Code extension](https://github.com/akamai/edgeworkers-vscode). You can also issue a cURL command to profile your EdgeWorkers code and then analyze the profiling data using [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/).
