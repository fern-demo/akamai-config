A built-in  [watermarking](doc:watermarking) module is now available to use in your EdgeWorkers functions. You can use it to watermark Over-The-Top (OTT) content delivered in an Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) format. This watermarking solution currently doesnâ€™t support interoperability with partial object caching. Please reach out to your account team if you require partial object caching.

We also added the [cwt](doc:cwt) module that lets you create, sign, and verify CWT tokens. The [watermarking](doc:watermarking) module supports cwt for token verification.
