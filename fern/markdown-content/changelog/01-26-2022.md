We are pleased to have several EdgeWorkers features and updates to announce.

**Updates to resource tier limits** 

- We updated the [resource tier limits](doc:resource-tier-limitations) to help expand the supported use cases for EdgeWorkers. 

    Updates to the **Basic compute** resource tier include:

  - Maximum CPU time during initialization increased from 30 to 60 milliseconds
  - Maximum wall time during initialization increased  from 100 to 200 milliseconds

    Updates to the **Dynamic compute** resource tier include:

  - Maximum CPU time during initialization increased from 30 to 60 milliseconds
  - Maximum wall time during initialization increased from 100 to 200 milliseconds
  - Maximum wall time per HTTP sub-request during the execution of all event handlers increased from 1 to 1.5 seconds

**Standard TLS now a supported delivery method** 

- [Standard TLS](https://techdocs.akamai.com/property-mgr/docs/serve-content-over-https), used to serve non PCI compliant traffic over HTTPS via an `edgesuite.net` edge hostname, is now supported as a delivery method for EdgeWorkers.

**Create a new version in the code bundle editor** 

- You can now create a new EdgeWorker version directly in the [code bundle editor](doc:code-bundle-editor). The code bundle editor opens with the last saved version or a Hello world example for you to use as a starting point for your new EdgeWorker version.

**Cancel an EdgeWorkers activation** 

- You can now use the [EdgeWorkers Management application](doc:manage-edgeworkers) or the [API](ref:cancel-activation) to cancel an EdgeWorkers activation if the status is still PENDING.
