The [getHeaders()](doc:response-object#getheaders) method for the Response Object is now available to return a JavaScript object that contains all HTTP response headers as properties. You can use the [getHeaders()](doc:response-object#getheaders) method on the `onOrigin Response` and `onClient Response` event handlers.
