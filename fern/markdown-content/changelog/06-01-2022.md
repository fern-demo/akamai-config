We've implemented several enhancements to expand the EdgeWorkers JavaScript API and debugging capabilities.  You'll also find some improvements to the developer experience.

- You can now construct a response with the [`request.respondWith()`](https://techdocs.akamai.com/edgeworkers/docs/request-object#methods) method in the `onClientResponse` event handler.

- In the `responseProvider` event handler, you can now obtain the body of the request object using the `text()` and `json()` methods for responses up to 16 KB in size.

- The [Enhanced debug header details for HTTP sub-requests](doc:enhanced-debug-header-details-for-http-sub-requests) now includes a "method" field that indicates the action to apply to a given resource.

- The `responseProvider` event handler now supports the POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE [methods](https://techdocs.akamai.com/edgeworkers/docs/event-handler-functions#event-handler-methods) in addition to GET and HEAD.

- The EdgeWorkers Management application has been updated to a new modernized framework to improve our development process and provide a better user experience.

- The EdgeWorkers activation throughput has been improved to reduce the time it takes for you to create and activate your EdgeWorkers functions.
