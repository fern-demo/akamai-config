Flexible composition lets different development teams within an organization work separately to create and deploy multiple EdgeWorkers for the same website.

Now, two or more EdgeWorkers can handle a single request. You can create and deploy code bundles that include dependencies defined in the `bundle.json` file. To learn more and for instructions on how to get started, go to the [Flexible composition](doc:flexible-composition) section in this Guide or check out the [EdgeWorkers APIs](ref:get-revisions), also available in beta.
