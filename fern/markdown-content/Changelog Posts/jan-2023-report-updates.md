We've updated the EdgeWorkers built-in reports to provide more information to help you optimize the performance and stability of your EdgeWorkers functions. You can use the [EdgeWorkers Management application](doc:manage-report-data) or the [API](ref:get-reports) to view these reports.

- The [Overview report](doc:overview-report) now includes the total number of sub-requests made from the EdgeWorker IDs selected for the report.

- You can now view the data in the [Execution time report](doc:execution-time-report) and [Memory usage report](doc:memory-usage-report) by various percentiles. Viewing percentiles can help provide you with a more in-depth measurement of performance.
