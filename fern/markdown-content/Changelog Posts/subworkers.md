You can now use subWorkers to make HTTP requests to EdgeWorkers on different properties or different accounts.

subWorkers let you divide the work and responsibilities for large projects amongst different teams. Each team can own a separate EdgeWorker, deploy it on different schedules, and use their preferred tool chains. You can also use subWorkers to share the results of computation across accounts and use Akamai optimizations to cache or accelerate a sub-request.

To learn more see, [Create a subWorker](doc:create-a-subworker) and [Fragment generation using subWorkers](doc:subworkers-tutorial) in this guide.
