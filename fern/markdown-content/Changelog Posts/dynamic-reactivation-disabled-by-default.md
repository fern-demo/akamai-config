[Flexible composition](doc:flexible-composition) lets you create and deploy multiple EdgeWorkers for the same website. You can enable dynamic reactivation when you [activate a parent EdgeWorker](doc:manage-edgeworkers#activate-an-edgeworker-version) by disabling the auto pin option.

By default, the initial revision created when you activate the parent EdgeWorker is pinned. Pinning prevents dynamic reactivation.
