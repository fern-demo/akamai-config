We've made the following updates to the code bundle editor and the encoding module:

- A diff tool is now available as part of the [code bundle editor](doc:code-bundle-editor). You can compare files from two versions of an EdgeWorker ID in a side-by-side view. This can help troubleshoot your code bundle by viewing the additions, removals, and changes to your code. 

- You can save a draft of an EdgeWorkers code bundle so that you can can continue editing files that contain validation errors.

- The [encoding module](doc:encoding) now supports the `base16`, `base64`, and `base64url` encoding methods.
