We are pleased to announce a new availability phase for EdgeWorkers. During the last availability phase we introduced the EdgeWorkers Management application, response orchestration, expanded product delivery support, and increased resource limits. We also added support for EdgeKV, a key-value store database. 

**Resource tiers and usage-based billing**

To start this new phase, we’ve introduced [resource tiers](doc:resource-tiers). Resource tiers let you select between different sets of resource consumption limits and corresponding billing rates for your EdgeWorkers functions. Currently two are available, Dynamic Compute and Basic Compute.

**Enhanced debug header support for HTTP sub-requests**

EdgeWorkers now supports enhanced debug headers for HTTP sub-requests. Each HTTP sub-request that is run returns a separate response header. To learn more, review enable [Enable enhanced debug headers](doc:enable-enhanced-debug-headers) and the [Resource tier limitations](doc:resource-tier-limitations) section.
