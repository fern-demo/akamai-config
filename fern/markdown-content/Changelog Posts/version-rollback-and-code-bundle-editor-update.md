If you've saved a draft of an EdgeWorker version you can now open it in the diff tool of the [code bundle editor](doc:code-bundle-editor).

You can now use the [EdgeWorkers API](ref:rollback-to-previous-active-version) or [Management UI](doc:manage-edgeworkers#roll-back-to-the-previously-active-version) to rollback to the previously active version of an EdgeWorker ID.
