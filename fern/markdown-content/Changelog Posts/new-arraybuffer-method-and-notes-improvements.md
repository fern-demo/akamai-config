The Request Object now includes the [`arrayBuffer()`](doc:request-object#arraybuffer) method. It returns a promise that resolves to an arrayBuffer containing the bytes of the request.

You can now add a note when using the [EdgeWorkers Management API](ref:api) to activate, deactivate, and roll back an EdgeWorker version.
